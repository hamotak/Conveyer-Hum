# Conveyer Hum

**A local toolkit for faceless YouTube videos — Veo video + ElevenLabs voiceover, all on your own computer.**

Conveyer Hum has **two modes**, picked from the sidebar:

- **Video Conveyer** — paste a script; it splits into scenes, generates an ElevenLabs voiceover and a Veo video clip for each scene, and stitches everything into one MP4 ready for YouTube.
- **Re-assembly** — build a video mostly from clips you already have: the AI matches each script scene to a clip in your Google Drive library, you swap any pick by hand, and only the missing scenes are generated fresh.

Everything runs locally through a simple web interface — no editing config files, no hosted backend. Finished runs can auto-upload to Google Drive, and the AI can reuse clips from past runs when scenes look similar, so the more videos you make, the cheaper and faster each new one becomes.

Channel profiles are supported — save a per-channel bundle (scene-split prompt, voice, motion style) and switch between them in one click on each run.

## Quick start (if you already have Node 20+ and FFmpeg)

From the **Conveyer Hum** project folder:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (the terminal prints the exact URL — it may be 3001/3002 if 3000 is taken) → **Keys & Settings** → paste your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `LABS69_API_KEY` → Save.

That single 69labs key powers **both** Veo video generation and ElevenLabs voiceover — no separate TTS account needed.

Then **Video Conveyer** → paste a script → run. First video done in 5–10 minutes.

For full onboarding (installing prerequisites, getting API keys, Drive setup), see [INSTALL.md](./docs/INSTALL.md).

## What's the stack

- **Next.js 16** (Turbopack) + **React 19** + **TypeScript** + **Tailwind 4**
- **Gemini Flash** — script → scene split (cheap, free tier OK for tests)
- **ElevenLabs via 69labs** — voiceover per scene (uses the same `LABS69_API_KEY` as video; MiniMax available as an alternative)
- **Veo 3.1 Fast via 69labs** — text-to-video per scene (Grok ~6-second clips available as a legacy option)
- **FFmpeg** — per-scene render + crossfade assembly
- **better-sqlite3** — local DB at `~/.conveyer-hum/hum.db`
- **Google Drive** — optional auto-upload + AI-search reuse across past runs

## How it works — Video Conveyer mode

```
script
  │
  ▼
[1] Scene split (Gemini) → JSON array of {text, visual_prompt, duration_hint_sec}
  │
  ▼
[2] Per scene IN PARALLEL:
       ├─ ElevenLabs TTS (via 69labs) → narration MP3
       └─ Veo via 69labs              → silent video clip
                                        (or download an existing clip from Drive if reusing)
  │
  ▼
[3] Per-scene render (FFmpeg) → MP4 with audio + video synced
  │
  ▼
[4] Final assembly (FFmpeg) → crossfade all clips into final.mp4
  │
  ▼
[5] (Optional) Drive sync → upload final.mp4 + raw clips + metadata
```

**Re-assembly mode** runs the same pipeline but with a manual reuse map — the scenes you matched to library clips skip video generation and download from Drive instead.

Concurrency: up to 3 TTS + 3 video jobs in flight per 69labs key. With 3 keys configured, 9 video jobs run in parallel.

## Where files live

- **Code** — the **Conveyer Hum** project folder
- **Data** (persistent, never wiped by code updates):
  - macOS / Linux: `~/.conveyer-hum/`
  - Windows: `C:\Users\YOU\.conveyer-hum\`

The data folder contains `hum.db` (SQLite — your settings, prompts, run history) and `runs/<folder>/` (per-run audio + video + final.mp4).
