# Prompt guide — how to write a channel's Scene Split prompt

This guide explains how to write a **Scene Split prompt** — the system prompt that tells the LLM (Gemini) how to slice your script into scenes and what kind of visuals to ask the video model for. It's the core of every **channel profile**.

> **Note on clip length.** Conveyer Hum now defaults to **Veo 3.1 Fast**, which is not capped at ~6 seconds. The scene-length rules below were written for the **legacy Grok** model, whose clips are a fixed ~6 seconds. They remain solid documentary-pacing guidance for any model, but the hard 6-second cap only applies if your channel still uses Grok. On Veo you can relax the upper bound somewhat.

You write it ONCE per channel on the **Channels & Prompts** page (Add new channel), then pick that channel from a dropdown on every New Run. No need to write per-scene prompts manually — Gemini generates them automatically from your channel's rules + your script.

Throughout this guide, "preset" and "channel profile" mean the same thing — a saved per-channel bundle whose main piece is the Scene Split prompt described here.

## What a preset must contain

Every preset has to cover **6 mandatory areas** for the pipeline to work correctly. If any is missing or wrong, the LLM either crashes the pipeline or produces unusable output.

### 1. Role / audience / tone (1–2 sentences)

Sets the channel identity. Example:

> *"You are the editor of a faceless YouTube longevity / women's health documentary channel. Audience: women 50–75. Tone: investigative documentary (Vox / BBC Earth), NOT clickbait."*

This anchors every visual decision downstream.

### 2. Scene length rules — **the most important section**

The default video model (Veo 3.1 Fast via 69labs) is flexible on length, but tight scenes still give the best documentary pacing. The **legacy Grok** model returns **fixed ~6-second clips** (we cannot ask for longer — 69labs runtime blocks it): on Grok, if a scene's narration is longer than 6 s the visual freezes on the last frame, and if it's shorter than ~3.5 s the clip gets trimmed and you waste the credit. The rules below keep scenes Grok-safe and read well on Veo too.

So every preset SHOULD specify (and MUST, if the channel uses Grok):

- **TARGET**: 8–13 words / ~3.5–5.5s narration
- **HARD MIN**: 7 words / 3.5s — anything shorter gets merged
- **HARD MAX**: 15 words / 6s — anything longer overshoots the clip

### 3. Sentence-handling rules

- **Cover the script verbatim** — no paraphrasing, no summarizing, no reordering. The pipeline relies on word-for-word equality between joined scenes and the original script.
- **Never split mid-sentence** — only at `.` `?` `!`. For raw transcribed style (no punctuation), split on natural narrator pauses (completed thoughts only).
- **Merge short fragments** — sentences shorter than 7 words ("zero.", "no supplement either.") get merged with the adjacent sentence into one scene. Combining sentences is allowed; splitting them is not.

### 4. Output JSON format — **REQUIRED**

The LLM must return strict JSON the pipeline can parse. Mandate:

```
{
  "text":              <verbatim slice of the script>,
  "visual_prompt":     <50–90 word English description of the shot>,
  "duration_hint_sec": <number, 3.5–6>
}
```

State in the preset that output must be:
- A strict JSON **array** (no markdown, no commentary, no code fences)
- No `text` field longer than 90 characters
- No `duration_hint_sec` greater than 6 or less than 3.5

If you skip this section, Gemini may wrap the array in markdown ```json blocks and the pipeline fails to parse.

### 5. Visual vocabulary — what to render

This is what gives your channel its branding. List 5–10 visual categories that match your niche, with concrete examples. For a Blue Zone documentary channel:

- **STATISTIC / DATA** scenes → pharmacy shelves, pill bottles, warm-amber microscope cells
- **LANDSCAPE** → region-specific establishing shots, golden hour, drone push-ins
- **FOOD / KITCHEN** → rustic tables, simmering stew, macro close-ups, warm earth tones
- **MODERN-MEDICINE CONTRAST** → sterile pharmacy aisles, cold fluorescents, blue-grey grading
- **ANONYMOUS ELDERLY** → weathered hands, backs of heads, silhouettes (NEVER faces close-up)
- **BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM** → warm macro-microscope, glowing molecules
- **ANTICIPATION / REVEAL** → slow push-in on single evocative object

The LLM picks one of these registers for each scene based on what the narration is literally about.

### 6. Hard bans (what to NEVER generate)

The video model will gladly generate clickbait or recognizable faces if you don't forbid it. Always include explicit bans:

- NO recognizable faces in close-up (these models can't reliably render specific named people anyway)
- NO young people, NO children
- NO sick / hospitalized / frail imagery (channel is active aging, not decline)
- NO on-screen text or numbers as graphics (no "70%" overlays, no big bold digits)
- NO clickbait visuals (giant "5", before/after splits, red arrows)
- NO cartoon / fantasy / sci-fi / neon styling

## Continuity — the biggest quality lever

The default behavior of an LLM splitting a script is to treat each scene as an isolated visual prompt. The result is jarring — scene 1 is Sardinia, scene 2 is a cell microscope, scene 3 is Sardinia again but a different village. Feels like 100 unrelated stock clips, not one documentary.

To fix this, your preset should explicitly say:

> *"Treat the script as ONE film. Consecutive scenes on the same topic share the visual world — same village, same kitchen, same light, same palette. Topic shifts get intentional transitions (push-in on object / rack focus). Group contrasts in BLOCKS of 2–4 scenes — avoid Sardinia → pharmacy → Sardinia → pharmacy ping-pong."*

This single paragraph makes the output dramatically more cohesive.

---

## Optional: Region auto-detect

If you cover **multiple regions** under one channel theme (e.g. all the Blue Zones), include a region-detection block so the LLM picks the right visual vocabulary from the script itself:

> *"If narration names Okinawa/Ogimi → tropical Ryukyu farmhouses, banana leaves, turquoise sea. If Sardinia → stone villages, olive groves, terracotta palette. (etc.) Default to Sardinia if nothing named."*

Now the SAME preset handles videos about Okinawa OR Sardinia OR Ikaria — you don't need a separate preset per region.

---

## Optional: Animation Motion override

The `/prompts` page has a separate Animation Motion field on each preset. This is the **motion-style suffix** appended to every Grok video request — controls camera movement (slow dolly vs aggressive whip pans), pacing, breathing focus, etc.

Leave it empty in the preset to use the global default. Fill it in if you want a different motion style per channel — e.g. one channel uses contemplative slow drift, another uses energetic kinetic motion.

## Worked example — Blue Zone Longevity preset

This is the actual preset we use for longevity / Blue Zone documentary channels (audience 50–75, niche: menopause / hormonal aging / supplements debunk / Mediterranean diet). Copy-paste into a new preset as a starting point and edit to your niche.

```text
You are the editor of a faceless YouTube longevity / women's health / Blue Zone documentary channel. Audience: women 50–75. Tone: investigative documentary (Vox / BBC Earth), NOT clickbait.

Split the narrator transcript into scenes for an AI video pipeline (xAI Grok via 69labs, fixed ~6-second clips — scenes must NOT exceed clip length or visuals freeze).

═══ RULES ═══

1. Cover script VERBATIM. Joined `text` fields = original script word-for-word. No paraphrasing.
2. Never split mid-sentence. Sentence ends only at `.` `?` `!`. For raw transcribed style (no punctuation), split on natural pauses between complete thoughts.
3. SCENE LENGTH: 8–13 words / 3.5–5.5s narration. HARD MIN 7 words / 3.5s. HARD MAX 15 words / 6s. Past 6s the clip freezes on the last frame.
4. MERGE short fragments (<7 words, e.g. "zero.", "no supplement either.") with the nearest thematically connected sentence. Result ≤ 15 words. Sentence boundaries respected — we only COMBINE sentences, never split them.
5. When in doubt: longer scenes within the 6s cap > rapid cuts. Documentary pacing.
6. Section announcements, hook/foreshadow lines, and statistical claims each get their own scene. But if a stat is a short fragment, merge it (rule 4).
7. NO scenes under 3.5s except the very last scene of the script.

═══ CONTINUITY ═══

Treat the script as ONE film. Consecutive scenes on the same topic share the visual world (same village, same kitchen, same light, same palette). Topic shifts get intentional transitions (push-in on object / rack focus). Group contrasts in BLOCKS of 2–4 scenes — avoid Sardinia → pharmacy → Sardinia → pharmacy ping-pong.

═══ REGION DETECT ═══

If narration names a Blue Zone, anchor visuals in that region. Otherwise default to Sardinia.

• SARDINIA / OGLIASTRO — stone hilltop villages, terraced olive groves, dry-stone walls, terracotta palette
• OKINAWA / OGIMI — Ryukyu farmhouses, sugar cane, banana / goya leaves, turquoise sea, humid green palette
• IKARIA — whitewashed Greek villages, fig trees, Aegean blue
• NICOYA — dry tropical forests, oxen carts, Pacific coastline
• LOMA LINDA — California valley orchards, walnut groves, dry desert sunlight

═══ VISUAL CATEGORIES ═══

Pick what matches narration:
• STATISTIC / DATA — pharmacy shelves, pill bottles, warm-amber microscope cells, stacked research papers
• LANDSCAPE — region-specific establishing shots, golden hour, drone push-ins
• FOOD / KITCHEN — rustic tables, hand-kneaded bread, simmering stew, macro close-ups, warm earth tones
• MODERN-MEDICINE CONTRAST — sterile aisles, blister packs, cold fluorescents, blue-grey grading
• ANONYMOUS ELDERLY — weathered hands, backs of heads, silhouettes walking paths, grandmother stirring pot (over-shoulder). Always 60+, dignified, purposeful
• BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM — warm macro-microscope, glowing molecules through tissue, medical-illustration realism
• ANTICIPATION / REVEAL — slow push-in on single evocative object, empty negative space

═══ HARD BANS ═══

NO recognizable faces in close-up, NO young people / children, NO sick / frail / hospital imagery, NO on-screen text or numbers as graphics, NO clickbait visuals, NO cartoon / fantasy / sci-fi / neon styling.

═══ MOTION ═══

Always describe motion (slow dolly, gentle parallax, rack focus, golden-hour light shifting). Static descriptions freeze in the clip.

═══ OUTPUT ═══

Strictly valid JSON array — no markdown, no commentary. Per scene:
{ "text": <verbatim slice>, "visual_prompt": <50–90 words, composition + subject + motion + lighting>, "duration_hint_sec": <number 3.5–6> }

For a 3,000-word script expect 240–340 scenes. Any `text` > 90 chars OR `duration_hint_sec` > 6 = rule 3 violated, re-split with merge. Any scene under 3.5s = rule 4/7 violated, merge with neighbor.
```

## Adapting to other niches

The same structure works for any faceless YouTube niche. Just swap:

- **Role / tone** — match your channel ("conspiracy theory documentary", "tech explainer", "cooking how-to", etc.)
- **Visual vocabulary** — list what your channel actually shows ("cooking" → kitchens, ingredients, hands chopping; "tech" → screens, circuit close-ups, neon city lights)
- **Region / location anchors** — if relevant; otherwise drop the section
- **Hard bans** — what your channel never shows (each niche has its own list)

**Keep**:
- The scene length rules (good pacing for any niche; the hard ~6s cap specifically applies only to the legacy Grok model)
- The output JSON format (the pipeline parser depends on it)
- The "treat the script as one film" continuity paragraph
- The hard ban on recognizable faces in close-up (a video-model limitation, not niche-specific)

---

## Common mistakes

- **Forgetting the 6-second cap on a Grok channel** → scenes freeze on the last frame (not an issue on the default Veo model, which isn't capped at 6s)
- **Forgetting the output JSON spec** → Gemini returns markdown that fails to parse
- **Allowing scenes under 3.5s** → wasted credits + jarring rapid cuts
- **Listing only positive examples, no hard bans** → the video model generates clickbait or recognizable faces
- **Skipping the continuity paragraph** → the output looks like 100 unrelated stock clips
- **Trying to control individual scene prompts in the preset** — you can't. Gemini generates per-scene prompts automatically; you only define the rules. If you need specific visuals at specific moments, edit the script or use multiple presets.
