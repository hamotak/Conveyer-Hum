# Installation guide — Conveyer Hum

Step-by-step setup for Windows 10/11 and macOS. Aimed at users with **zero programming experience** — every command can be copy-pasted exactly as shown.

**Total time:** ~30 minutes the first time, ~5 minutes for any update later.

---

## What you need before starting

- A computer running **Windows 10/11 or macOS** (Linux works too but isn't covered here)
- **~5 GB free disk space**
- Stable internet (first install downloads ~600 MB)
- A **Google account** (free — for the Gemini API key and optional Google Drive sync)
- A **69labs.vip account** (paid subscription — covers BOTH Veo video and ElevenLabs voiceover)

> **Heads-up about the command line.** Steps below ask you to use the terminal. On Windows it's called **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**. On macOS it's called **Terminal**. You only paste commands and press Enter — no need to understand them.

---

## Part 1 — Install the three required programs (one time, ever)

You install **Git**, **Node.js**, and **FFmpeg** once on your computer. Then you never touch them again.

### 1.1 Install Git

Git is what downloads the project and pulls updates.

**Windows:**
1. Open https://git-scm.com/download/win — download starts automatically
2. Run the downloaded `.exe`. Click **Next** on every screen (defaults are fine), then **Install**
3. Open **Command Prompt** (Win key → type `cmd` → Enter), paste:
   ```
   git --version
   ```
   You should see `git version 2.x.x.windows.x`. If yes, Git is installed.

**macOS:**
1. Open **Terminal** (⌘ + Space → type `terminal` → Enter)
2. Paste:
   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```
3. A popup asks to install Command Line Developer Tools. Click **Install**. Wait a few minutes.
4. Verify:
   ```
   git --version
   ```

---

### 1.2 Install Node.js

Node.js runs the Conveyer Hum code.

1. Open https://nodejs.org/
2. Click the green **LTS** button on the left. The `.msi` (Windows) or `.pkg` (macOS) download starts.
3. Run the installer. Click Next/Continue on every screen, accept the license, Install. Enter your computer password if asked.
4. **CLOSE all open terminal windows and open a fresh one.** Node isn't visible to windows opened before installation.
5. Verify:
   ```
   node --version
   ```
   Should print `v20.x.x` or higher.

---

### 1.3 Install FFmpeg

FFmpeg stitches your clips into the final video.

**Windows:**
1. Open **Command Prompt as administrator** (Win key → type `cmd` → right-click → Run as administrator)
2. Paste:
   ```
   winget install Gyan.FFmpeg
   ```
3. Wait for download (1–2 minutes)
4. **Close that admin window and open a new normal one.** Verify:
   ```
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

**macOS:**
1. If you don't have Homebrew, install it first. Open https://brew.sh and copy the install command (starts with `/bin/bash -c "$(curl ...`). Paste in Terminal, press Enter. Takes 5–10 min.
2. Then in Terminal:
   ```
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```
3. Verify:
   ```
   ffmpeg -version
   ```

## Part 2 — Download and install Conveyer Hum

### Step 1 — Pick a folder

Go to your Documents folder.

- **Windows:**
  ```
  cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents
  ```
- **macOS:**
  ```
  cd ~/Documents
  ```

### Step 2 — Download the project

```
git clone <CONVEYER-HUM-REPO-URL>
```

Replace `<CONVEYER-HUM-REPO-URL>` with the repository URL you were given.
10–30 seconds — you'll see progress lines ending with `Receiving objects: 100% ...`.

(If you received the project as a folder or ZIP instead of a repo URL, just put
that folder in your Documents folder and skip to Step 4.)

### Step 3 — Enter the project folder

```
cd Conveyer-Hum
```

### Step 4 — (Windows only) Add the folder to antivirus exclusions FIRST

> **Why this matters:** Windows Defender sometimes truncates native binaries during `npm install`, which breaks the project. Adding the folder to exclusions prevents this.

1. Open **Windows Security** (Start → "Windows Security")
2. **Virus & threat protection** → **Manage settings** under "Virus & threat protection settings"
3. Scroll down to **Exclusions** → **Add or remove exclusions**
4. **Add an exclusion** → **Folder** → pick your `Conveyer-Hum` folder

If you skip this and `npm install` fails, the `postinstall` script will try to fix it automatically by copying working binaries from a sibling project (if you have one). But adding exclusions is the proper fix.

### Step 5 — Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

3–8 minutes depending on internet. You'll see lots of scrolling text — that's normal. When done, you'll see `added NNN packages`.

## Part 3 — Get your API keys (2 keys total)

### Key 1 — Google Gemini (for splitting scripts into scenes)

1. Open https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click blue **Create API key**
4. Key starts with `AIza...`. Copy and save it temporarily.

Free tier is more than enough. No payment info required.

### Key 2 — 69labs (Veo video + ElevenLabs voiceover)

1. Open https://69labs.vip
2. Sign up / sign in, pick a plan
3. Dashboard → **API Keys** → copy your key (starts with `vk_`)

This single key covers **both** Veo video generation and the ElevenLabs voiceover — there is no separate TTS account to create. The voice itself is chosen later, inside the app.

Tip: you can paste multiple `vk_` keys later (each on its own line) to run multiple 69labs accounts in parallel.

---

## Part 4 — First launch and configuration

### Step 1 — Start the app

In your terminal (still inside the `Conveyer-Hum` folder):

```
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
▲ Next.js 16.x.x (Turbopack)
- Local:    http://localhost:3000
✓ Ready in 1300ms
```

If port 3000 is already taken, Next picks the next free port (3001, 3002, …) and prints that instead — use whichever URL it shows.

**Don't close this window** — it's the running server. Keep it open while using the app. To stop the app, press **Ctrl+C** in this window.

#### One-click launch for next time

After installation, you can use:

- **Windows:** double-click `start.bat` in the project folder
- **macOS:** double-click `start.command`. The first time, macOS may block it — right-click → Open → confirm.

These do the same thing as `npm run dev` and open the browser automatically.

### Step 2 — Open in browser

Open Chrome / Edge / Safari / Firefox. Type:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

You'll see the **Conveyer Hum** interface with a left sidebar.

### Step 3 — Paste API keys

1. Click **Keys & Settings** in the sidebar
2. Under **Required API Keys**, fill in:
   - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` — Gemini key from Part 3 Key 1
   - `LABS69_API_KEY` — 69labs key from Part 3 Key 2
3. Click **Save all changes**. Green checkmark = saved.

That's all that's required. The voiceover has a working default (ElevenLabs via 69labs) — change it any time in **Keys & Settings → Pipeline tab → Voice Over (TTS)**.

You're ready to make videos. See [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) for what to do next.

## Part 5 — (Optional) Connect Google Drive

Drive sync is **optional** but strongly recommended. Every finished run auto-uploads to your Drive, and the AI can later reuse clips from past runs for new videos — saving Grok credits.

### Step 1 — Create a Google Cloud project

1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Project selector (top, next to the logo) → **New project** → name it "Conveyer Hum" → **Create**
4. Pick the new project from the selector

### Step 2 — Enable Google Drive API

1. Search bar at top → type `Google Drive API` → Enter
2. Click the result → **Enable**

### Step 3 — Set up OAuth consent screen

1. Hamburger menu → **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**
2. **External** → **Create**
3. **App name** — "Conveyer Hum", **User support email** — your email
4. Scroll down. **Developer contact** — your email again
5. **Save and Continue** through Scopes (no changes needed)
6. **Test users** → **Add users** → add your email → Save and Continue
7. **Back to Dashboard**

### Step 4 — Create OAuth credentials

1. Left sidebar → **Credentials**
2. **+ Create Credentials** → **OAuth client ID**
3. **Application type:** Web application
4. **Name:** "Conveyer Hum Local"
5. **Authorized redirect URIs** → **+ Add URI** → paste the **exact callback URL the app shows**. Conveyer Hum derives this from the actual origin it's running on, so it is NOT always port 3000 — if Next started on 3001, the callback is `http://localhost:3001/api/gdrive/oauth/callback`. The **Keys & Settings → Google Drive Sync** section displays the precise URL to register; copy that. For a default install on port 3000 it is:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/gdrive/oauth/callback
   ```
6. **Create** — a popup shows **Client ID** + **Client Secret**. Copy both.

### Step 5 — Paste into Conveyer Hum

1. Back at http://localhost:3000 → **Keys & Settings**
2. Scroll to **Google Drive Sync** section
3. Paste **Client ID** into `GDRIVE_CLIENT_ID`
4. Paste **Client Secret** into `GDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET`
5. Leave folder ID fields **empty** — app auto-creates folders on first sync
6. Tick **Auto-upload finished runs to Drive**
7. Scroll up → **Save all changes**

### Step 6 — Authorize

1. The status banner shows "⚠ Not connected"
2. Click **Connect Google Drive**
3. Sign in with your Google account (the test user)
4. Click **Advanced** → **Go to [App Name] (unsafe)** — this is normal because the app is yours, not publicly verified
5. Approve permissions
6. Redirected back → "Google Drive connected ✓"

Drive sync is now active. Finished runs upload automatically.

## Updating to the latest version

When a new version is released:

1. Stop the app (Ctrl+C in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running)
2. Go into the project folder:
   - Windows: `cd %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Conveyer-Hum`
   - macOS: `cd ~/Documents/Conveyer-Hum`
3. Pull latest code:
   ```
   git pull
   ```
4. Update dependencies (usually <1 min):
   ```
   npm install
   ```
5. Start again:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

**Your API keys, prompts, presets, and run history are NOT affected** — they live in `~/.conveyer-hum/` outside the project tree, so updates can never delete them.

---

## Common installation problems

### `is not a valid Win32 application` or `next-swc.win32-x64-msvc.node` errors (Windows)

Windows Defender truncated a downloaded binary. Add the project folder to Defender exclusions (Part 2, Step 4), delete `node_modules`, re-install:

```
rmdir /s /q node_modules
npm install
```

The `postinstall` script also tries to auto-fix this by copying working binaries from sibling projects.

### `npm install` fails with permissions errors (macOS)

```
sudo npm install
```

If sudo also fails, your Node install is corrupted — reinstall Node from https://nodejs.org/.

### Port 3000 already in use

If port 3000 is taken, Next.js automatically starts on the next free port (3001, 3002, …) and prints that URL — just open whichever it shows. You can also force a port:

```
PORT=3001 npm run dev
```

Note: the Google Drive OAuth callback follows the app's actual origin (it is NOT hardcoded to port 3000). Whatever port the app runs on, register that exact callback URL in your Google Cloud OAuth credentials. The **Keys & Settings → Google Drive Sync** section always shows the precise URL to register.

### "Save failed: Internal Server Error" on Settings page

The native SQLite module didn't install correctly. Try:

```
npm rebuild better-sqlite3
```

If that doesn't fix it, see the antivirus warning (Windows) and re-install.

### "Token expired or revoked" in Drive section

Misleading message — usually means Google Drive API isn't enabled for your project yet. Expand the raw error in the banner, click the link to Google Cloud, click Enable, wait 1 minute, refresh.

### macOS: `start.command` says "cannot be opened because it's from an unidentified developer"

Right-click the file → **Open** → confirm in the dialog. macOS remembers this and won't ask again.

## Where your files are stored

Two separate locations — code and data kept apart so updates never destroy your work.

**Code** (replaced on every `git pull`):
- The folder you cloned into (e.g. `~/Documents/Conveyer-Hum`)

**Data** (persistent — settings, presets, run history):
- macOS / Linux: `~/.conveyer-hum/`
- Windows: `C:\Users\YOU\.conveyer-hum\`

Inside that folder:
- `hum.db` — SQLite database (settings, API keys, prompts, presets, run history)
- `runs/<run-folder>/` — per-run output (audio MP3s, scene MP4s, final.mp4)

When Drive sync is on, raw clips are uploaded then deleted locally to save space. The final video stays on disk.

> **macOS users:** the folder starts with a dot so Finder hides it. To see it: press **⌘ + Shift + .** (period) in Finder, or **⌘ + Shift + G** and paste `~/.conveyer-hum/`.
